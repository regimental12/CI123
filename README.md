This is a basic space invaders game built using your boiler plate code. I have aligned the aliens correctly and changed the graphics for them. I have also updated the player graphic.
Every 30 points or so a pick up appears which gives the player an extra one hundred points. once all the enmies have been killed the game displays a game over screen.

All sprites , music and fonts are freeware or on open source licence.


To build the code: g++ src/*.cpp std=c++11 -lSDL -lSDL_image -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_ttf

To run from there ./a.out (or what ever you may have called it during the build)
